# python-challenge
I am completing this assignment before we have finished the Python material in class, as I am quite familiar with Python and know how to do everything in the assignment. Therefore, I may have used topics not covered in the lessons. The resources that I used to learn Python in the past were:
1. Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code
2. Fred Baptiste's Python 3: Deep Dive series of courses: https://www.udemy.com/course/python-3-deep-dive-part-1

I did not remember how to write to a file, so I had to look that up for the PyBank script. That was credited within the comments in that Python script. I used the same method to write to a file in the PyPoll script but did not choose to credit it again as I had already credited it in the other script.
